# handlebars-template
A boilerplate for handlebars, using gulp. Project built in collaboration with [Adam Auckland](https://github.com/adamauckland) (to whom I owe many beers)


# Initialize project

Run `npm install`

Allow node modules to install

Run `gulp`

# Project includes:

- gulp
- sass
- browser-sync
- uglify
- css-nano
- imagemin
- handle-bars
- autoprefixer
- clean
- concat
- sourcemaps

Running gulp will compile everything from /src (sass, js, images, fonts and handlebar templates/partials) into /dist.
